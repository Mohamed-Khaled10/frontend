The fontend is the part were the website really starts to get together. In this part the user, booking, court, Navigation and admin are added to make the routes in the backend function by fetching the data from the backend and making demands on them so that it has functionality that's for the .js files.
The .css files are made for every component to be able to style them by adding animations to them, changing the colour of them and editing to make the website collectively look more pleasing for the users.
Lastly, no third party plugins were used in this part of the project.
